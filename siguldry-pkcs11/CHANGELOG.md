## [2.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- The module now supports the CKM_ML_DSA mechanism and exposes ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87 keys for
  signing. The only supported mechanism is the pure ML-DSA signature; none of the pre-hash
  mechanisms are supported at this time (#269)

- The module now supports the CKM_EDDSA mechanism and exposes Ed25519 and Ed448 keys for signing.
  At this time, the module only accepts inputs that are 32 or 64 bytes in length, which is not
  compliant with the specification but does support signing with OpenPGP or anything else that
  computes the signature on a raw digest (#269)


## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added

- The module now accepts an environment variable, LIBSIGULDRY_PKCS11_KEYS, to control what
  keys are exposed as tokens (#201)

### Changed

- The default log level for the module is now WARN, rather than INFO (#201)

- The log level for function instrumentation on most PKCS11 functions has been dropped to
  DEBUG as it was overly verbose for info-level logs (#201)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- The module requires version 0.6 or greater of the siguldry client proxy as
  the IPC format has changed (#166)

### Fixed

- Fix an assumption that C's char type is signed (#161)


## [1.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- Everything (initial release).
