## Unreleased

### Fixed

- The bridge now checks that the server/client connection is not dead before bridging.
  This was commonly seen when restarting the server without restarting the bridge, which
  would result in the client failing the first few requests while the stale connections
  were slowly drained (#250)


## [0.8.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- The client proxy now comes with an `Accept=no` systemd socket variant. When run
  in this mode, systemd starts a single service instance for the proxy. While this
  reduces the isolation between client connections, in scenarios where the client
  proxy is configured to unlock the keys (and thus, no secrets are being provided
  by clients) it performs much better, particularly in highly concurrent scenarios.
  The new socket unit is named `siguldry-client-shared-proxy.socket` (#221)

- The client now gracefully shuts down idle connections to the signing server
  after a configurable `idle_timeout` (default 600 seconds). The connection is
  transparently re-established on the next request. This should be set somewhat
  lower than the server's idle client timeout, and larger than the client's
  `request_timeout` (#241)

- The server has a new configuration option, `idle_client_timeout`, which defaults
  to 1 hour. When a client connection has not submitted a request within that time,
  the server shuts it down. This is a compliment to the client-initiated timeout and
  should only impact mis-behaving clients (#240)

- The server has a new configuration option, `connection_watchdog_timeout`, which
  defaults to 3 hours. Request handlers check in with the watchdog while processing
  requests, and failure to do so will result in the client connection being terminated
  if the timeout is reached without a check-in. This is to protect against faults on
  the server, like if a signing request is sent to the helper over IPC and a response
  is never received by cause the helper deadlocks, queries unresponsive hardware, etc.
  The watchdog logs at an error level and this should be investigated carefully if it
  is observed by administrators (#240)

### Changed

- The client now makes use of Tokio's multi-thread runtime rather than its single
  thread runtime so that when running in `Accept=no` mode it can take advantage
  of all available cores (#221)

- **Breaking** The client's `request_timeout` configuration is now expressed as
  an integer number of seconds (for example `request_timeout = 30`) rather than
  a `[request_timeout]` table with `secs` and `nanos` (#241)


## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- The server now only acquires a database connection for requests that require
  it, which greatly improves performance with moderate to high concurrency
  (#220)

- The server, bridge, and client now all raise the limit on open files to the
  system limit, rather than the soft limit of 1024, which is necessary when
  issuing many concurrent requests (#229)

- **Security** Client certificates with an interior NUL byte in their common
  name no longer truncate the field to that NUL byte. If you have issued a
  client certificate with an interior NUL byte which is the prefix of another
  user, that client certificate can be used to list the keys they have access
  to. The client would still need to have the key access password to sign
  anything, however (#236)


## [0.7.2] - 2026-06-03

### Fixed

- The systemd units now include an Install section so they can be enabled (#214)

- The `Keys` section of the Siguldry client config now actually uses the
  CREDENTIALS_DIRECTORY environment variable value as the base for relative
  paths used in the `passphrase_path` field, allowing systemd credentials to be
  used as documented (#215)


## [0.7.1] - 2026-06-01

### Changed

- The MaxConnections setting on the systemd sockets is now explicitly set with a default
  of 256; the prior systemd default was 64. This setting impacts the number of concurrent
  operations allowed and should be tuned by the administrator (#200)

- Logging no longer includes synthetic span open/close events and a new `--span-events` flag
  has been added to the CLIs. This greatly reduces the logging verbosity (#207)

- Debug level logging events were added for each server API call, and digests that are signed
  are now logged at the info level (#207)

### Fixed

- Improved the error details for clients of the proxy service and of the signing helper (#203)

- The client will now actually retry requests automatically as it claims it would when
  the underlying connection fails unexpectedly (#208)

- Connections are now shut down gracefully; you should no longer see any "early EOF" errors
  on the server or connections finishing with "tls_retry_write_records" errors on the
  bridge (#209)


## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-06

### Changed

- Configuration files with unknown keys are now rejected. Previously, the unknown keys were ignored
  (#176)

- The dependency on asn1 was updated from 0.23 to 0.24 (#170)

### Fixed

- Generated signing key encryption passphrases using OpenSSL's rand_priv_bytes. Previously,
  rand_bytes was used. Both use cryptographically secure pseudo random generators, but the priv
  variant uses a separate instance (#181)

- Fixed the default configuration location of siguldry-client; the value checked,
  /etc/siguldry/siguldry/client.toml for system units, did not match the documented location of
  /etc/siguldry/client.toml. The behavior now matches the documentation (#171)


## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed

- key passwords are now encrypted first using the user password, then with any binding
  X509 certificates. This allows for additional bindings to be added without needing
  all the user passwords to rebind secrets (#168)

- The IPC format used in the siguldry-client proxy command has changed; it now
  includes a version and an "Unsupported" response so future breaking changes
  are not necessary (#166)

### Fixed

- toml is no longer an optional dependency; it technically never was as it was used
  in the Display implementation for configurations (#160)

- sequoia-keystore and tempfile are no longer dependencies (tempfile is a
  dev-dependency). This was true of the 0.5.0 release, but the dependency
  itself was not dropped (#160)

### Added

- Example configuration files are now included with the crate (#158)


## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-12

This release was entirely focused on making Siguldry a functional replacement
for Sigul. There were no substantive changes to the Sigul client
implementation.

There were numerous breaking changes to the database schema, the Siguldry
protocol, and the Rust APIs, but since Siguldry was far from functional that's
probably okay.

Starting from this release, database migrations for the Siguldry server will be
provided and the schema is expected to be fairly stable. When migrations are
required, they will be noted prominently in the change log.

However, the Rust APIs will definitely change. The CLI may also change as the
Fedora infrastructure team provides feedback. All breaking changes will be called
out in the release notes, of course.

The primary interface for signing is the libsiguldry_pkcs11.so PKCS#11 module,
which will be stable.

### Added

- The siguldry client configuration now accepts a list of keys to unlock
  automatically (#109)

- The siguldry server CLI now has a sub-command to import keys and users from a Sigul
  database and associated data directory (#118)

- The siguldry server now supports signing with keys in PKCS#11 tokens (#112)

### Changed

- The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.88 (#96)

- Keys stored in the database are now encrypted with AES-256-GCM rather than
  AES-256-CBC. Furthermore, if PKCS#11 binding is configured, the key material
  is bound in addition to the key passphrases (#114 and #150)

- Keys are no longer decrypted in the main server process. Instead, requests
  are forwarded to a Unix socket, bound by the systemd siguldry-signer.socket
  unit. Each client connection spawns a new instance of
  siguldry-signer@.service. This process is responsible for decrypting keys and
  signing requests (#112)

- The siguldry client list-keys command now only shows the user keys they have
  access to (#151)

### Removed

- The server no longer has a command for OpenPGP signing; this is provided via
  the PKCS#11 module (#147)

- The server no longer supports digesting server-side; the Sign call has been
  changed to accept a digest and the binary field of the protocol frame has
  been removed (#147)


## [0.4.1] - 2025-11-25

### Fixed

-  Fixed building the siguldry crate outside the git repository by relocating the sqlx fixtures to
   the crate (#95)


## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-24

### Added

- Added support for the `sign-certificate` command to create certificates for Sigul-managed keys (#48)

- A new protocol, based on Sigul 1.2, has been added; this includes a new server, bridge, and
  client implementation. At this time it is still incomplete, but does support basic signing
  requests, such as inline PGP signatures (#64, #72)

### Removed

- The legacy Sigul client is has been removed as a default feature and been
  moved into the `v1` submodule. To continue using the legacy Sigul client,
  enable the `sigul-client` feature and adjust your imports accordingly (#64)

### Changed

- Updated the pyo3 test dependency from 0.26 to 0.27 (#84)


## [0.3.1] - 2025-06-12

### Changed

- The test suite uses sequoia v2.0.0 as this is what Fedora ships (#53)


## [0.3.0] - 2025-06-12

### Added

- The library now logs when the TCP connection is established before attempting
  to negotiate the TLS session (#43).

- Added support for the 'user-info' command to the siguldry client (#32)

- Added support for the 'new-user', 'modify-user', and 'delete-user' commands to the siguldry client (#46)

- Added support for the full suite of key management commands to the siguldry client. These include
'key-user-info', 'modify-key-user', 'list-keys', 'new-key', 'import-key', 'delete-key',
'modify-key', 'list-key-users', 'grant-key-access', 'revoke-key-access', change-key-expiration',
'get-public-key', 'change-passphrase', and 'list-binding-methods' (#47)

### Changed

- The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is now 1.84 to align with RHEL 9.6 and 10.0 (#45)

- **Breaking change**: Several error variants have been moved from `siguldry::error::ConnectionError`
  to `siguldry::error::ClientError`. As `ConnectionError` is a variant of `ClientError`, this reduces
  the amount of nested error type matching required. The variants are: `Sigul`, `Serde`, and `InvalidSignature` (#46)

- **Breaking change**: The `ConnectionError::Fatal` variant has been replaced with `ConnectionError::ProtocolViolation` (#46)
