# Contribution Guide

Thanks for considering contributing to Siguldry, we really appreciate it!

## Development Setup

### Rust

To build and test this project, you will need a relatively recent version of
[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). The current required version is documented in the `Cargo.toml`

The minimum supported Rust version tracks the latest toolchain available in Enterprise Linux
releases. For example, when RHEL 10.1 was released, the MSRV was bumped from 1.84 to 1.88.

### System Dependencies

A few dependencies from your distribution are also required to build all the crates and run the
test suite. This is expected to run on Fedora or RHEL, although it should work elsewhere.

```bash
dnf install -y \
  clang \
  kryoptic \
  nss-tools \
  opensc \
  openssl \
  openssl-devel \
  pesign \
  pkcs11-provider \
  pkg-config \
  python3-devel \
  sbsigntools \
  sequoia-sq \
  sqlite-devel
```

The Secure Boot signing test uses the sample UEFI application. With a rustup-managed
toolchain, build it and the host binaries before running the tests:

```bash
rustup target add x86_64-unknown-uefi
cargo build --target x86_64-unknown-uefi -p sample-uefi
cargo build --workspace
```

If you want to run the full test suite including the tests for migrating a Sigul database
to Siguldry, you will also need podman and podman-compose to generate the test data:

```bash
dnf install podman podman-compose
cargo xtask generate-sigul-data
```

Finally, the test suite runs via [nextest](https://nexte.st). While running with `cargo test`
may work with a single test thread, this is not recommended or checked regularly:

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-nextest
cargo nextest run
```
